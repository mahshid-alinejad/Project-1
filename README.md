# Data Understanding 

By analyzing audience engagement, content effectiveness, and overall impact in the digital landscape, we can gain valuable insights into the effectiveness of our social media strategies and make data-driven decisions to optimize performance and achieve business objectives.

1. Audience Engagement:Comments, Likes and Shares, Click-Through Rates (CTR: measures the percentage of users who click on a link or call-to-action within the content. )
2. Content Effectiveness:Title, Tags, Description, View Count, Consistency, Publishing Frequency
3. Overall Impact in the Digital Landscape:View counts and share counts
By analyzing these factors and leveraging available data, you can gain valuable insights into content effectiveness and overall impact in the digital landscape, enabling you to optimize social media strategies and achieve business objectives.

The dataset that I’m working with is a snip of US Youtube data from Aug 2020 to Apr 2024. Our YouTube dataset maintain a list of the top trending videos on the platform. According to Variety magazine, “To determine the year’s top-trending videos, YouTube uses a combination of factors including measuring users interactions (number of views, comments and likes). 



# Data Analysis

We conducted data analysis by sorting our dataset based on "view counts" to identify trends and patterns in video popularity.



- We found out top trending videos from Aug 2020 to Apr 2024,as well as which day of the week and what time of the day are peak times. So if someone needs our consultant on best days to post and which hour is the best hour to post.  There is also a strong positive correlation between likes and view count. Our data represents that top industries in Youtube channel are gaming, sports and News. 



- After analyzing the dataset, several key findings emerge. The top 10 fastest viral YouTube videos within the first 24 hours highlight the potential for rapid audience engagement. Understanding trends in the number of trending videos by day of the week offers insights into optimal upload times. The top 10 channels by total view count showcase successful strategies for building a large audience. Analysis of average views by month reveals seasonal viewership patterns, while common tags provide guidance for content optimization. Metrics such as total views and comments by channel and video category offer comprehensive insights into audience engagement levels and content preferences. Additionally, examining the frequency of posting by top channels and metrics like total comments, dislikes, and likes by video views provides valuable strategies for maximizing audience interaction and content effectiveness.




- On average, videos with disabled comments and ratings have significantly fewer dislikes compared to those with enabled comments and ratings. Additionally, despite disabled engagement features, such videos still garner a higher view count. This correlation may indicate that limiting user feedback could lead to a more positively perceived content, potentially driving higher engagement in terms of likes and views. However, further analysis is needed to ascertain causation and account for other factors influencing viewer engagement.

# Recommendation


Our data shows that Saturday are the best days to go viral and the Youtube video postings are usually go viral after 9 hrs of publishing. According to our analysis it also takes an average 5 days for videos to trend. Our data represents that top industries in Youtube channel are gaming, sports and News. People blogging has been one of the top brands which might help increase the sale for companies with consumer goods products such as skin care, clothing, etc.,

Based on these datas we can recommond people who just want to start a business which product categories have the most views and if gaming for example top industry maybe selling a toy can bring a high sales by posting on Youtube as a markeing platform. 
We dived deeper into the data and we conducted a research on top categories based on higherst view counts to figure out what industries under consumer goods products will also thrive on Youtube platform as their digital marketing strategy, pet products, cars, traveling, etc...

YouTube tags can certainly impact the discoverability of a video, but they're just one factor among many. Tags help YouTube's algorithm understand what your video is about and can influence where it appears in search results and recommendations. However, having tags alone doesn't guarantee more views.
The content quality, relevance, engagement metrics (like watch time, likes, comments), title, description, thumbnail, and even the overall channel authority all play crucial roles in determining a video's success. So while tags can help, they're just a piece of the puzzle.
Ultimately, creating high-quality content that resonates with your target audience and optimizing various aspects of your video (including tags) can contribute to getting more views.

Average view count for videos with tags: 2483568.8453644025
Average view count for videos with no tags: 3428577.530856502
Videos with no tags tend to get more views.


The more engagement involves things such as leaving the comment section for example always open, also there is a strong relation between using more tags and getting more views.  Channels with higher frequency of posting get more views as well. 

As the name suggests it recommends based on what is currently trending/ popular across the site. This is particularly useful when you don't have past data as a reference to recommend product to the user.
